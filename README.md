# Finetuning ML models for analyzing benthic imagery #
## This repo is still work in progress 
## The notebooks import annotations from squidle.com and use it to fine-tune models for new classification and object detection tasks and then do inference on new dataset
## Classification (wholeframe annotations)  is ready while object detection notebook  and classifications (point annotations) are under development
## 

## Installation ##
```bash

conda env create -f environment.yml
```
```bash
